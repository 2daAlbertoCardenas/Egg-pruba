A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow.[1] This can occur only
 when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are exactly or very closely aligned (in syzygy) with Earth 
between the other two, and only on the night of a full moon. The type and length of a lunar 
eclipse depend on the Moon's proximity to either node of its orbit.[citation needed]

A totally eclipsed Moon is sometimes called a blood moon for its reddish color, which is
 caused by Earth completely blocking direct sunlight from reaching the Moon. The only 
light reflected from the lunar surface has been refracted by Earth's atmosphere. This 
light appears reddish for the same reason that a sunset or sunrise does: the Rayleigh 
scattering of bluer light.

Unlike a solar eclipse, which can only be viewed from a relatively small area of the 
world, a lunar eclipse may be viewed from anywhere on the night side of Earth. A total
 lunar eclipse can last up to nearly 2 hours, while a total solar eclipse lasts only 
up to a few minutes at any given place, because the Moon's shadow is smaller. Also unlike 
solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view without any eye protection or special 
precautions, as they are dimmer than the full Moon.
